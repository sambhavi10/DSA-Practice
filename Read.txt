Unordered Sets in C++ Standard Template Library

An unordered_set is implemented using a hash table where keys are hashed into indices of a hash table so that the insertion is always randomized. 
All operations on the unordered_set takes constant time O(1) on an average which can go up to linear time O(n) in worst case 
which depends on the internally used hash function, 
but practically they perform very well and generally provide a constant time lookup operation. 


 Set is implemented as a balanced tree structure that is why it is possible to maintain order between the elements (by specific tree traversal). 
 The time complexity of set operations is O(log n) while for unordered_set, it is O(1).
